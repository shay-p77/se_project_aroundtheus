Around The U.S.
This project features a profile of Jacques Cousteau. It highlights some photographs taken in various places.
I used HTML and CSS to create the layout and styling of the webpage. I used flexbox, grid, and BEM to make the page look exactly like the layout on figma.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
